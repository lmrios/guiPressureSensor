# GUI for a Paros Scientific Pressure Sensor
This is a Graphical User Interface for a Paros Scientific Pressure Sensor.
In the near future I will probably use BMP280 Pressure Sensore + Arduino, since I think it is easily avaible for everybody.

This program plots in real-time the recieved data on a embbeded graph.
It uses:
- Python3
- PyQt5
- pyqtgraph
- threading
- pyserial
- queue and pandas ( future implementation)

### Preview
Here is what it looks like:
